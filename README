This project accompanies my blog post over at http://lerouxtechnologies.com/x-adventures/

In this project, I try to load an image from the computer and draw in inside a window. It's not a comprehensive tutorial
of X11 but I'm hoping it can be used by people looking to try the library.

Setup required :

- Linux system with X11 installed
- Cmake for managing the project.
- C++ compiler
